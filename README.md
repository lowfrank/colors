# colors: an IDE for the betty programming language

As the description clearly states, colors is an IDE for the [betty programming language](https://github.com/lowfrank/betty). You can open, modify, save and run betty files inside it, with the aid of syntax highlighting and a nice UI. Through the `settings.json` file, you can modify the appearance of the application and make it yours!
To run colors, you must have the following prerequisites:
  - A `betty.exe` file, possibly compiled with the `--release` flag (don't forget to write its path to `settings.json`).
  - Rust installed with version 1.65 and above.
